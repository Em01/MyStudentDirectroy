#Student Directory
This project was given to us during the first week at Makers Academy. The idea was for us to compile a directory of our fellow students on the cohort. The project lasted two weeks with the aim that we should gain more familiarity with the command line, Ruby and also learn about creating a project from scratch. This repository is a continuation of the previous Student Directory as I started exploring how to use a csv file and then attempted some other excercises in week 2 of Makers Academy.
